### Sass pipeline

- Source Sass files are under `src/scss`
- Compilation is via templates at `src/assets/css`
    
    Using templates means that Eleventy's own watchers trigger compilation and ensure that changes to Sass files are kept in sync with Browsersync's refresh schedule.
- CSS is transpiled to the same path under `dist` as the templates exist under  `src`:
    ```
    // input
    src/assets/css/{filename}.11ty.js

    // output
    dist/assets/css/{filename}.css
    ```
