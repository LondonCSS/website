  <p>
    London CSS is an event for anyone with an interest in CSS. We aim
    to support the community in London from professional developers to
    curious and/or creative minds. Our goal is to provide an evening
    of interesting talks while having some food and meeting other CSS
    enthusiasts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a safe and friendly environment: all organisers, sponsors
    and attendees are required to follow our <a href="/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Speaking</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome and encourage everyone to submit a talk wether you are
    an experienced or first time speaker. We want to hear about what
    thrills you! For more information please contact us through
    hello@londoncss.dev or @londonCSS.
  </p>

  <h2>Team and Sponsors</h2>
  <p>
    London CSS was started by
    <a href="https://twitter.com/igoratron">Igor Czerwinski</a> and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/RazvanSpatariu">Razvan Spatariu</a>
    but, as of late 2018, is organised by
    <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverturner">Oliver Turner</a> and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ohhelloana">Ana Rodriguez</a>. Like
    most community-run meetups, profit is not a goal of London CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    London CSS is made possible thanks to the generosity of our
    sponsors. We are grateful to the following organisations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Samsung Internet</li>
    <li>Financial Times</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With their help we're able to put these events together.</p>
