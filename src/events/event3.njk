      Dear London CSS friends,

      Unfortunately the ongoing health situation means we have to cancel our in-person event. We’re really sorry about the inconvenience this may cause. 

      Instead, we will be providing a remote session. Full details on how to attend will be published as soon as possible: please keep an eye on [@LondonCSS](https://twitter.com/londoncss) for more information and reach out there or by [email](mailto:hello@londoncss.dev) out if you have any questions.
      
      Thank you for your understanding

      twitter: gsnedders
      bio: |
        Sam Sneddon has spent a decade working on web browsers trying to make them better. While their work has centred on building infrastructure to help browser developers ensure interoperability of their product, they've also long been around a number of standards groups, including the CSS WG.
    presentation: 
      title: "The CSS WG in a Time Machine"
      content: |
        CSS is an imperfect language, and for all the criticism often directed at the CSS WG and browser vendors, they're not going to claim it's flawless either. 
        
        This talk will look at a variety things that probably should be different if anyone does manage to invent a time-machine.

      name: Rowan Manning
      twitter: rowanmanning
      bio: |
        Rowan is a Principal Engineer at the Financial Times, and head of the Origami team who build and maintain components. His background is mostly in Front End, and he’s spent 12 years championing accessibility and progressive enhancement across agencies, startups, and large organisations.

        Rowan is the original author of [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), an accessibility testing tool – he spent a large part of his career working too hard on open source. Nowadays he’s better at managing work/life balance, and is more likely to be found playing D&D than coding outside of office hours.
    presentation: 
      title: How to Steer An Oil Tanker
      content: |
        [Origami](https://origami.ft.com/) is the Financial Times’ component system, and it’s been going strong for around six and a half years. In this talk I’ll cover the challenges my team faces maintaining 50+ components and 6 web-services, and how we ensure that our work continues to be relevant in an ever-changing tech landscape.

        Glen Maddern is an independent front-end web developer, consultant & educator. He's the co-creator of Frontend Application Bundles, Styled Components & CSS Modules, co-founder of Linc and creator of Frontend Center, and was an organiser of CSSConf AU & JSConf AU.
    presentation: 
      title: Subatomic Styled Components
      content: |
        One of the interesting and under-explored avenues CSS-in-JS opens up is the ability to experiment with wholly new styling constructs, rather than simply transferring ideas & techniques from CSS to a new ecosystem.

        I've been tinkering with the idea of "traits" -- a kind of "subatomic" styling -- for several years, but never really shared it beyond colleagues. I've experimented with versions of it in Sass, CSS modules, Styled Components & React Native, and while the implementations are all a little different, the concept seems to be working well.

        I'll be talking about the concept, how it's evolved, how it relates to popular CSS-native techniques like Tachyons/Tailwind, and how you can try it out yourself!
