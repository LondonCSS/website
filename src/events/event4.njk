        CSS was first available in a browser in August 1996. In 2003, Dave Shea released CSS Zen Garden as a demonstration of "what can be accomplished through CSS-based design" until submissions stopped in 2013. 
        
        Since then, not only CSS but also the tooling around it and browser support has massively improved. But... as our environment grew, so too did a gap in developer knowledge of how the CSS under their framework of choice *actually works*. 
        
        [Style Stage](https://stylestage.dev/) allows CSS practioneers at any level to revisit foundational skills while increasing their familiarity with modern CSS capabilities by restyling the same base HTML. In this talk, learn more about how Style Stage came to be and about the contributor process. You'll also pick up a few tips and tricks for creating your stylesheet submission with modern CSS.
