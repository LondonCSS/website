      title: "Getting Creative with Keyframes"
      content: |
        Working with keyframes can be difficult even if you only have one animation but the real problems begin when you have 3 objects with 5 animations, each of which has different keyframes, duration, timing-function... and yet they all need to be exactly synchronized. So how do we do that?!

        In this session Amit breaks down the thought process he uses to create animations, bringing tips and ideas from his personal experience.
