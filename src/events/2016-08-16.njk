      title: The Magic of the Infinite Scroller
      content: |
        At Badoo we face many technical challenges on a daily basis. One of the challenges I'm going to talk about is our solution to how we showed a large number of users on a single page. Currently there are a lot of solutions to this on the market but none of them suited our needs. We wanted a balance between maintainability and the-best-technical-idea-ever! Our solution was our version of the infinite scroll - let the browser do all the magic, while we relax with a coffee. During this talk I will be focusing on the idea, some of the technical details and the highlights of our implementation.

      content: |
        In this talk, we're going to take a look at the pros and cons of using CSS Modules in production. That will include a very brief refresher on the what and why of CSS Modules, explanation of how to implement them server-side (sans Webpack!) and implications of using them in a team environment.
