## Our goals

London CSS is an event for anyone with an interest in CSS. We aim to support the community in London from professional developers to curious and/or creative minds. Our goal is to provide an evening of interesting talks while having some food and meeting other CSS enthusiasts.

We want this to be a safe and friendly environment: all organisers, sponsors and attendees are required to follow our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Speaking

We welcome and encourage _everyone_ to submit a talk, whether you are an experienced or first time speaker. We want to hear about what thrills you! For more information please contact us through <hello@londoncss.dev> or by tweeting to [@LondonCSS](https://twitter.com/londoncss).

## Team

In late 2018 curation of London CSS was taken up by [Ana Rodrigues](https://twitter.com/ohhelloana), [Kevin Lewis](https://lws.io) and [Oliver Turner](https://twitter.com/oliverturner).

As the current organisers we'd like to recognise the contributions of those who went before us: this meet-up has a long history! Many thanks and much respect to [Stuart Robson](https://twitter.com/StuRobson), [Igor Czerwinski](https://twitter.com/igoratron) and [Razvan Spatariu](https://twitter.com/RazvanSpatariu): you all rock â™¡

## Sponsors

London CSS is made possible thanks to the generosity of our sponsors. We are grateful to [Samsung Internet](https://samsunginter.net) and to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/) for their support: with their help we're able to put these events together and recognise the contributions of our amazing speakers
